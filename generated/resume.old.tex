Most of my technical work is in my GitHub profile, you can visit my
profile at

{\bf My Cool Side Projects:}\crlf
Usually I practice my skills via some helpful project that I tend to
mantain over time, I think it's really good to automate repetitive tasks
and jobs a bot or some type of automation software can do on its own.
Examples of this are most of my GitHub repositories:

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  {\bf {\em \useURL[url2][https:github.com/nclsbayona/nclsbayona][][My
  Profile README]\from[url2]:}} My GitHub profile's readme is an example
  of a programming and automation project I've realized.
\item
  {\bf {\em \useURL[url3][https:github.com/nclsbayona/nclsbayona.github.io][][My
  WebPage]\from[url3]:}} I recently developed my own website which acts
  as a showcase for my abilities as web developer.
\stopitemize

{\bf Programming Languages:}\crlf
Throughout my life, I've worked in many projects and therefore, I've
adquired a lot of experience in various programming languages. Next,
I'll name a few and some relevant stuff I learnt from them.

\startitemize
\item
  {\bf {\em C++:}}\crlf
  The first programming language I learnt was C++, the most valuable
  thing I think I learnt from my C++ learning was programming logic. I
  think that C++ is a really great language because it acts as a basis
  for other languages and many tools that have been working flawlessly
  since it first appeared almost 40 years ago.
\item
  {\bf {\em Python:}}\crlf
  After learning C++, I decided to learn Python, because its reputation
  was great, it simplified the development process as its syntax was
  similar to natural language and included really powerful mathematical
  tools that helped to perform tasks that might involve mathematical
  stuff.
\item
  {\bf {\em Java:}}\crlf
  After learning Python, I learnt Java since it was a more mature
  language, Java was highly used in a lot of enterprise-scale
  applications and many cool frameworks like Spring Framework where
  developed considering Java as a first-class citizen which gave it an
  advantage.
\item
  {\bf {\em Other relevant information:}}\crlf
  Also, I have basic knowledge of other programming languages like
  {\em {\bf TypeScript}, {\bf JavaScript}, {\bf C}, {\bf Dart}} and
  {\em {\bf Swift}}, as well as markup languages such as
  {\em {\bf YAML}, {\bf HTML}, , {\bf Markdown}, {\bf XML}} and
  {\em {\bf JSON}}, and other tech-related tools like {\em {\bf Git}},
  {\bf Kubernetes - Kubectl}, {\bf Docker - Podman}, {\bf Github
  Actions}_ and {\em {\bf AWS}}.
